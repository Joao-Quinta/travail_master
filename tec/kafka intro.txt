producer gets data into kafka (cluster)
produces data into topics

what is in a kafka cluster? 
-n brokers --> local storage

consumers read the data stored in the kafka cluster
a consumer can also be a producer and vice versa (use different topics)
multiple consumers to the same topic are independant

zookeeper --> consensus agreement 
- cluster management
- store ACLs 

consumers and producers are decoupled -- 

topics -- collection of related messages/events 
can be thought of as a sequnce of events
a topic is store somewhere
for better scaling, we break the topic into partitions
a partition is a log -- strict ordering

kafka message
headers, key, value, timestamp


broker 
manages partitions - manages log files
takes requests from producers and consumers -- pub/sub
replication -- each partition has a numberof replications -- leader & followers
the producer wrties to the leader, the borker updates the followers automatically


kafka 
keeps track of where each consumer is in each partition (the offset)
